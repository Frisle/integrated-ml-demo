            The Titanic Dataset is a dataset composed the data of 891 passengers that were on the Titanic when it sank. For each passenger, we have part or all of the following informations :    
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>name: the name of the passenger;</li>
            <li>sex: the sex of the passenger;</li>
            <li>age: the age of the passenger;</li>
            <li>survived: the passenger survived or not;</li>
            <li>class: the class the passenger traveled in;</li>
            <li>sibSp: the number of siblings and spouses / husbands the passenger has aboard;</li>
            <li>parCh: the number of parents and children the passengers has aboard;</li>
            <li>ticket: the ticket number of the passenger;</li>
            <li>fare: the price the passenger paid for their ticket;</li>
            <li>cabin: the cabin reference of the passenger;</li>
            <li>embarked: the port from which the passenger embarked (Cherbourg, Queenstown or Southampton).</li>

        <p>
            The importation from the csv file to the IRIS instance in the docker container is done through the "csvgen" package, thanks to the `iris/iris.script` file. The first step of this project was to create a CRUD to manage these passengers. In the two other tabs of this section, you will be able to Create, Read, Update or Delete instances of Passenger objects.
