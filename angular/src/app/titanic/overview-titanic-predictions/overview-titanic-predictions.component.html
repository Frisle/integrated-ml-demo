            Finally! The prediction. In the next tab, you will be able to add yourself to the list of passengers. In the last one, you will be able to use your freshly trained models to make predictions!<br>
            The prediction result will give you the following details:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The predicted value;</li>
            <li>The probability of that prediction, only in cases of classification models;</li>
            <li>The variables used by the model to make the prediction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the third tab, you'll just have to search for a passenger and click on his name to select it. The same goes for the trained model you would like to use.
